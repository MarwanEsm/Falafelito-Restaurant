Website.com's "Unlimited" services are provisioned in a shared hosting environment. Any account found to be adversely affecting the performance of other Subscriber accounts by excessively using network bandwidth, server storage, memory or CPU resources, will be flagged by Website.com administrators and anti-abuse controls. These Subscribers will then be asked to consider Virtual Private Server (VPS) or Dedicated Server services. Serious offenses will result in the account service suspension or termination, with or without notice.

You will be solely responsible for all renewal costs and for any other costs in doing so. Subscribers may choose to opt in or out of the Automatic Domain Renewal service via your account control panel.

Promotional offers, including special introductory rates, promotional rates, or any non-regular pricing, are only available to new customers and are only valid for the initial term. All domain names registrations will renew at the regular renewal rate.

Subscribers who have purchased their domain name registration at a promotional price are subject to a Domain Transfer Fee when they transfer their registration to another domain name registrar during the purchased registration term.

Subscribers who wish to transfer their domain name registration to another domain name registrar while the registration is expired are also subject to a Domain Transfer Fee.
